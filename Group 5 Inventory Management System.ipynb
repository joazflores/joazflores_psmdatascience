    "##### Scenario: You are tasked with developing an inventory management system for a small retail store. The store needs to keep track of products, their quantities, and pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Task 1: Write a function find_max_price(products) that finds the most expensive product in the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Task 2: Write a function find_min_stock(products) that identifies the product with the lowest stock, so the store can reorder it.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Task 3: Write a function average_price(products) that calculates the average price of all products to help with pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Task 4: Write a function remove_out_of_stock(products) that removes products with zero stock from the inventory list.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Task 5: Create a main program that simulates the store’s inventory management process. Allow the user (store manager) to input product details, and then use the functions to analyze and manage the inventory, providing insights such as the most expensive item, average pricing, and stock status.\n"
