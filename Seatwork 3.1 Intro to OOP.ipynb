    "6. Supplementary Activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks\n",
    "1. Modify the ATM.py program and add the constructor function.\n",
    "2. Modify the main.py program and initialize the ATM machine with any integer serial number combination and display\n",
    "the serial number at the end of the program.\n",
    "3. Modify the ATM.py program and add the view_transactionsummary() method. The method should display all the\n",
    "transaction made in the ATM object and log it to a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions\n",
    "1. What is a class in Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is like a templplate for creating objects in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do you think classes are being implemented in certain programs while some are sequential(line-by-line)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are better suited for more complex programs since it makes the code more modular and since some programs are worked on by multiple programmers \n",
    "having classes makes it easier for other people to modify or troubleshoot parts of a complex program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How is it that there are variables of the same name such account_firstname and account_lastname that exist but\n",
    "have different values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Having classes within a code helps in defining variables which are otherwise having the same name since classes can store different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explain the constructor functions role in initializing the attributes of the class? When does the Constructor function\n",
    "execute or when is the constructor function called?\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor function is called in python using the __init__ command. With the __init__ line the constructor will be initilized\n",
    "when it's function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the benefits of using Constructors over initializing the variables one by one in the main program?\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes codes more effiecient and cleaner compared to initializing variables one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we get further into the uses of python we are slowly being introducted to much more advanced methods of making the codes\n",
    "more efficient and cleaner like using constructors. Since the more complicated programs are usually made up of different compontents\n",
    "each comprising a lot of functions within them. And since most programs are maintained by several programmers it really helps\n",
    "make the codes more modular so development and troubleshooting becomes easier and more effecient for everyone.\n",
